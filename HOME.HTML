		<h2>WE ARE</h2>
        <p>The Blind Livelihood Organization Inc., a non – profit, non stock  socio – civic and charitable group and its consistent adherence to help our less fortunate brothers and sisters. In line of the organization objectives conducting several laudable project such toassist the community and necessary skills in music and massage.  </p>
		<P>Organizations of disabled people, at all levels, are a vehicle for mutual support and solidarity. Disabled people who belong to these groups find that they have a common purpose, that of promoting their right to live as citizens in society.<P/>
		<p>Individuals with vision impairment are also more likely to experience restrictions in their independence, mobility, and educational achievement, as well as an increased risk of falls, fractures, injuries, poor mental health, cognitive deficits, and social isolation. Connecting with others who are going through similar challenges is one of the best ways to overcome your disability, as well as counter any feelings that you're alone in this fight. People in the group can share their challenges, their solutions, as well as emotional support with each other.</p>

				<p>WHAT WE DO?</p>
				<p>We can do massage,Yes, blind people can become massage therapists. Research has shown that visually impaired individuals can develop and modify their palpation skills, which are essential for massage therapy . In fact, there are blind and visually impaired individuals working as massage therapists in various countries, such as Taiwan . However, it is important to address the specific challenges faced by blind massage therapists, such as communication barriers and limited access to health information . </p>

				<div class="box">
				<p>WHAT WE SERVE?</p>
				<P>The primary objective of school feeding program is to provide meals (breakfast, lunch, snack, milk…) to alleviate short term hunger, increase attention span, facilitate learning and obviate the need for children to leave school to find food. So, by the help of the warm hearted people, we make a activity which are the feeding program every month. By this way we can assure and glad to see children happy and enjoyed by serving them food with love and care. </P>
			</div>

			<div class="box">
				<p>WE?</p>
				<p>Having to deal with sight loss or low vision is merely one of the challenges that the visually impaired are facing when living life. Blind individuals are just like anyone else but they just can’t see. Is this case as simple in real life as in our minds, though? As one of Envision’s founders we have built a world around us that serves the majority. That means that any individual different than the average, such as the visually impaired, faces difficulties because they’re not what is considered to be average.</p>

			<h2>ACTIVITIES</h2>
			<p>By providing social services like proper health care for persons with disabilities, we can ensure that more people enter the workforce. This collective effort to assist persons with disabilities ultimately contributes to the economy's growth and improves the overall social setting.</p>
			<p>Whether it's helping someone run errands or tutoring a child with special needs, you're promoting their personal empowerment. Not only are you helping them build the tools to be more independent, but you're also improving their self-esteem and confidence.</p>
			<p>Empowerment of persons  with disabilities is essential, as support can be given to the affected persons and their families. This can be done by creating programs to provide medical care and shelter for neglected persons with disabilities.</p>
			
			<h2>FEEDING PROGRAM</h2>
			<P> We are monthly conducting a feedding program to all children in our street. To share what we have been recieved. Evidence shows that these programs have the ability to improve the health, nutrition and education of children, and offset lost income for struggling families.

			<h2>GIFT GIVING PROGRAM</h2>
			<P> We often give gifts to re-confirm or establish our connection with others, which means that they're a reflection of both the giver and the receiver, as well as their unique relationship. Giving a gift to someone we care about allows us to communicate our feelings and appreciation for them. But then, we can't do this by our own hand, money, efforts. So we are collecting some of goods from the very kind personnel of every government, organization, and teams. We ask first to sponsored these things that we want to be happen, by this person's we succesfully done by serving and conducting gift giving for every members of our organization. Despite of every doubts that challenge us to be the barrier to undo what we want to do. Blessed to thank god for guiding us everyday to fulfill our dreams. </p>
